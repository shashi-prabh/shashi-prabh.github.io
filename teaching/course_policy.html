                    I encourage discussing the assignments with classmates. However, all submitted work must entirely be
                    written by the student (alone) in own words. Submission of work copied from classmates, from the web
                    or any unauthorized source will be considered an incident of cheating. I will award penalty of one
                    letter grade upon the first incident, and will award the fail grade (F) and report to the university
                    disciplinary committee upon the second incident.
                    <li>Use of Mailtrack or any other tracking service in emails is prohibited. I will not respond to any such email. </li>
